This is project where I have trained a transformer neurla network from scratch to be able to generate poetry.
The model is trainied on the gutenberg poetry corpus and is able to generate poetry in the style of the corpus.

GOTO RUN_THIS and run the jupyter notebook.
It uses one of my models to generate poetry.


A sample of the generated poetry is given below:

```
Ah, never with a throat that aches with song,
Beneath the white uncaring sky of spring
Afterakes that speech there split Ald "Just as a Haunted goat to good house,
And there, he broke, and down at all night reformation
The fader Rutulchman's mad helmet tender,
```

You can use the main.py file to train your own model.
You may as well change the training data to train on any other corpus.
